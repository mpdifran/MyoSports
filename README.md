# MyoSports

Myo Sports is intended to be an app to give athletes more information about their games. Sports of interest include:
- Tennis
- Golf
- Baseball

## First Steps

Some good first steps for the application would be the ability to detect a forehand vs a backhand in tennis, or the
handedness of a baseball swing.

## Recording

The apps main function right now is data recording. Each recording file is timestamped with the start time, and
accessbile through iTunes when the device is connected. Files are separated by type of data: IMU, accelerometer,
gyroscope, and EMG.
